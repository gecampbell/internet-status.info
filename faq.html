<h1>Frequently-Asked Questions</h1>
<h2>Does this really check if the Internet is up?</h2>
<p>Yes</p>
<h2>Does it check the whole Internet?</h2>
<p>Technically speaking, it only checks that portion of the Internet
that is visible to you. But that's the only part that's important, right?</p>
<h2>Is it possible that the checks are delayed?</h2>
<p>No, the checks are performed in real-time, every time you load this page.</p>
<h2>Why should I trust you?</h2>
<p>Because routers and things.</p>
<h2>What happens if I don't understand English?</h2>
<p>The site will adjust its analysis for your browser's specified language.
It currently supports multiple languages, including Russian and Chinese.</p>
<h2>How much does this cost?</h2>
<p>I don't charge for this service.

who, thanks to my hard work, now know that the Internet is
still functioning.</p>
<h2>How are you able to test the whole Internet?</h2>
